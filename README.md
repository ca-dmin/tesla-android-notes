My notes for using Tesla Android without Carplay.

# Playstore

instead of using the playstore I did the following:
- install F-Droid from https://f-droid.org
- from within F-Droid install "Aurora Store"
- in "Aurora Store" go to "Spoof Mangager" 
- I set it to "Samsung S9+"

benefits:
You could install many more apps than you would be able to install with the "rpi4-default"-Device.
Also I'm using "anoynmous" Login
