My notes for using [Tesla Android](https://teslaandroid.com) without Carplay.

# Read the Release notes

just saying: [Release notes](https://teslaandroid.com/release-notes)



# Aurora Store instead of Playstore

instead of using the playstore I did the following:
- install F-Droid from https://f-droid.org
- from within F-Droid install "[Aurora Store](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.aurora.store/)"
- in "Aurora Store" go to "Spoof Mangager" 
- I set it to "Samsung S9+"

pro:
- You could install many more apps than you would be able to install with the "rpi4-default"-Device.
- Also I'm using "anoynmous" Login ; not need to fiddle with logins all the time

contra:
- not always working - when installing paid apps for instance (taking the Playstore instead)
- no updates
- ... just look at [Aurora Store](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.aurora.store/)


# Wireguard

Using to connect to my [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) instance at home :)
Also using it currently for Faking GPS data.

# Faking GPS data 

it works for me kind of.
